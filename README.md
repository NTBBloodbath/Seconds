Seconds is a utility package to transform seconds to minutes, hours, etc. and vice versa
quickly, easily, understandable by humans and without external dependencies
so its performance is excellent and it's extremely lightweight!

------

## Why use Seconds?
Since Seconds doesn't contain external dependencies, it's extremely lightweight (only 12kB!)
and very fast, it becomes the perfect tool to manage and transform time!

------

# Quick start
## Installation
Seconds requires Python 3.x and can be installed through `pip` with the following command.
```sh
pip3 install -U seconds

# Or from github's latest commit
# Available branches:
#   â€¢ master
pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/NTBBloodbath/Seconds@branch
```

## Usage example
This is a brief example of Secs.
```py
# Lets import Secs class from Seconds Package
from seconds import Secs

# Lets pass 5 minutes to seconds and seconds to 10 minutes
Secs("5m") # => 300
Secs(600)  # => 10 minutes
# But we want to abbreviate our minutes so we
# will pass the abbrev parameter to options
Secs(600, abbrev=True) # => 10m

# Lets pass 6 months to seconds and then pass 1 year to seconds
Secs("6mo") # => 110451600
Secs("1y")  # => 220903200
```
